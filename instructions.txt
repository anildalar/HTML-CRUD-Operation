No we will not use the above templete becuase that is angular template

we need pure html templte

Lets find some one :)

I Found it
https://codepen.io/zic72/pen/BayvgZo

This above templete actually using bootstrap

let get this bootstrap in

We have added bootstrap file in the templete


Lets setup git repo
Bcause always good to setup git repos first


OMG this templet is using jquery 

But we already included Bootstrap 5.x. and BS5.x does not support JQuery

My Model is not working because i am using BS 5.

in BS 5 you have to change 
	1. data-toggle to data-bs-toggle
	2. data-dismiss to data-bs-dismiss
