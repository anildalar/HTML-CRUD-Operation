HTML CRUD Operation with Pure Javascript

We need
1. Ready Made HTML Template with form and table (Done)
2. Some Rest API (We will use Strapi)

Lets get started guys :)

1. Ready made html templete
https://codepen.io/QuocHa/pen/YpveoJ

No we will not use the above templete becuase that is angular template

we need pure html templte

Lets find some one :)

I Found it
https://codepen.io/zic72/pen/BayvgZo

This above templete actually using bootstrap

let get this bootstrap in

We have added bootstrap file in the templete


Lets setup git repo
Bcause always good to setup git repos first


OMG this templet is using jquery 

But we already included Bootstrap 5.x. and BS5.x does not support JQuery

My Model is not working because i am using BS 5.

in BS 5 you have to change 
	1. data-toggle to data-bs-toggle
	2. data-dismiss to data-bs-dismiss


Guys my HTML template is now ready

I have also started the CI/CD pipeline so that this can be accessed anywhere in the world with a public address

Lets wait


https://anildalar.github.io/HTML-CRUD-Operation/
this is the public address

Now lets start our Part 2

2. We need SOME CRUD Rest API

SO what is the Strapi.?

Stapi is a headless CMS  (Content Management SYstem) which can provide us ready made REST APIs.

Lets Start with STRAPI

https://strapi.io/

This is the official website

We can setup a strapi project with this command

npx create-strapi-app@latest htmlcrudproject

htmlcrudproject = the project name

Choose the quick project
Make sure you have installed nodeJS between 12.x= > to <=16.x

It will take time guys
Lets wait for a while
:)
You need to have a very good internet connection for this :)

I have 1000 Mbps connection

Hurrey We have done installation with strapi 

Lets setup

We will create a ToDO APP

First Create a Collection Type

Go inside the Content Type Builder
Create new collection type

Name it as TODO

Click on Continue

Now select the field

Select a text field

You can name it as anything you like

i will call it as "Content"
Make this as required field

No click on save

Yup our collection is now created

let click on the Content manager

Insert some content

Remember one thing

1. Save and then dont forget to publish it

Now what we need ?

We Need API Right ?

Let me show how you can get it

Go to setting

Go to roles

Click on the public edit pencil icon

Selec the permission for TODO content type

Click on the select All

Save it

Now let check the api

We need to have postam for API Testing

Open the Postman

Lets create a Postman collection to organize all the api in one place

Click on add a request

No lets install the strapi documentation plugin 


npm run strapi install documentation

stop the strapi
by pressing Ctrl + C

install the documentaion

we will run this command in bash terminal not the window terminal


Yup we have install the documentation plugin

Now we have complete documentation


YEs our both thing are setup correcctly

1. HTML CURD template
2. Some API (We are using Strapi for this)

So Lets start

Lets save all the request in the collection

CREATE - Done

I have also save all collection

Lets also export this Collection as JSON so that you can import directly in 
POSTMAN

Lets get strat with real talk i.e

HTML CRUD Operation with pure JS
Even though our template contain jquery but we will not use jquery at all

Only pure javascript


Lets start

Let do the get first

So we will get records from the below api


http://localhost:1337/api/todos

So will start with script tag
Now for api calling 

We can use
1. Built-in XMLHTTPRequest Class (Very Outdated)
2. Built-in Fetch API (Very Latest and Advanced)

We will use Fetch Api for APi calling in this part

fetch('url') method will return the Promise Object

so we will handle the promise object with then catch and finally block

so basic syntext is
PO.then().then().then().catch().finally();

We can use two then block in a fetch api.
Even thought we can use as many as we want but we only need two

so first then block will parse the JSON data
second then block will read the parsed JSON data

we also dont need a finally block in a PO chain


Up the data is comming up

We will append this data to tbody

So remove the hardcode data inside the tbody

lets leave only one tr 

We will remove
Email
Address	
Phone



Now i am going to teach very import topic i.e

DOM Traversing

1. Parent to child
		querySelector() method
2. Child to parent
		closest() method

Lets understand the table structure first

Also most important thing to remember here is 

we are dynamically collectin the html and after that we are putting in DOM

SO dynamically gernated html element has to access with diffent way

Let me show you guys

Lets take a small break :)

Welcome back to 2nd part of

HTML CRUD Operation with PUre Javascript 


Welcome to HTML CRUD Operation with PUre Javascript  Part 3

Today we complete the Create functinality
Lets start

How to dissmiss the model programatically in bootstrap 5

Thats it


There is a problem
Table is not refresh

We want to add without refresh
